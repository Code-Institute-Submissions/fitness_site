### Objectives

Build a web app that fulfils a real world purpose. It should be composed of multiple reusable apps and include an authentication mechanism, e-commerce functionality and a form with validation. The project must be connected to an SQL database.

 ### What does it do?
 
It allows users to register and login to the fitness site in order to access member benefits. These benefits include booking one of three membership options. The site has a blog, which users can make changes to and some JavaScript features, such as a modal on the home page. 
 
### How does it work
 
This website uses Django as a framework and is styled using Bootstrap.

 
## Tech Used
 
### Some of the tech used includes:
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
 a high-level Python framework handling user authentication, content administration, site maps, RSS feeds and more
 - [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
 is used to create a responsive layout
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
 is used to install http-server
- [bower](https://bower.io/)
 is used to manage front-end components
- [JavaScript](https://javascript.com/)
 is used for interactivity
- Pencil for Wireframes

## Extras

Given more time on this project, I would style the stripe payment section and create the option for users to directly call instructors when logging in via mobile. I would also test the views more extensively.
